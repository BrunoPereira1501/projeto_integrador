## Abstract

Being at the base of cities development, civil infrastructures are fundamental to ensure that a
population can live comfortably and the economy can prosper. Although structures are designed
to be in equilibrium, as they age, forces are applied in their normal use, introducing new variables,
hence the need to investigate the deformations in relation to the original design, to assess the
operational safety of the structure. Constant supervision is crucial in order to avoid, on the one
hand, unplanned outages - which incur high costs - and, on the other hand, catastrophic structural
failures which can lead to lives lost. The need, therefore, arises to evaluate the supervision methods
used and point out possible errors associated with them. The introduction of robotic procedures
is a beneficial path, in terms of time and accuracy in supervision, being a viable option and will
therefore be the object of study at this internship. The technique used will be the construction of
point clouds using two different means - ground laser scanner and high-resolution 3D lidar sensor.
